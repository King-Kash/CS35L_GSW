# Results Page Testing Guide

## Overview
The new Results page provides comprehensive search functionality for both locations and reviews, plus personalized recommendations based on user history.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Search Functionality
- **Text Search**: Searches location names, descriptions, and review contents
- **Tag-based Search**: Filters locations by tags (quiet, aesthetic, collaboration, etc.)
- **Combined Search**: Supports both text and tag filtering simultaneously

### 2. Recommendation Algorithm
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Finds users with similar rating patterns using Pearson correlation
- **Content-based Filtering**: Recommends locations with similar characteristics to user preferences
- **Popularity-based Fallback**: Shows popular locations for new users without rating history
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines multiple algorithms for better recommendations

### 3. User Interface
- **Tabbed Interface**: Separate tabs for Locations, Reviews, and Recommendations
- **Search Result Display**: Clean cards showing relevant information
- **Authentication Integration**: Recommendations require login

## API Endpoints

### Search Endpoint
```
POST /search
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "searchTerm": "coffee shop",
  "tags": ["quiet", "aesthetic"]
}
```

### Recommendations Endpoint
```
GET /recommendations
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Database Schema Updates

### Location Model
Added `tags` field:
```javascript
tags: [{
    type: String,
    lowercase: true,
    trim: true
}]
```

### User Model
Enhanced with recommendation data:
```javascript
searchHistory: [{ searchTerm, tags, timestamp }],
viewedLocations: [{ location, viewCount, lastViewed }],
preferences: { preferredTags, avgRatingGiven }
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Search Functionality
1. Navigate to the homepage
2. Use the search bar in the navbar to enter terms like "library" or "coffee"
3. Add tags like "quiet" or "aesthetic"
4. Click the search button
5. Verify the Results page loads with relevant locations and reviews

### 2. Test Recommendations
1. Create/login to a user account
2. Add some reviews for different locations
3. Navigate to search results and click the "Recommendations" tab
4. Verify personalized recommendations appear

## Sample Data for Testing

You can add sample locations with tags using the API:

```javascript
// Sample location with tags
{
  "name": "Quiet Library Corner",
  "location": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [-118.2437, 34.0522]
  },
  "rating": 4.5,
  "description": "Perfect spot for focused studying",
  "tags": ["quiet", "library", "focused", "academic"]
}
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: More sophisticated recommendation algorithms
2. **Real-time Recommendations**: Dynamic updates based on current activity
3. **Social Features**: Friend-based recommendations
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Date ranges, distance, rating thresholds
5. **Search Analytics**: Track popular searches and trends
